  * Each edition of "Medical-Surgical Nursing" has not only covered new developments in nursing, it has actively anticipated trends and advances. The 7th edition keeps readers on the cutting edge with the very latest information on nursing practice. It presents more detailed coverage of basic anatomy and physiology, pathophysiology, medical management, and nursing care than any other book available. Its focus on clinical outcome management emphasizes patient outcomes and makes the material understandable. A completely new design integrates information in the book with web enhancements on the accompanying Evolve website, such as online exercises, care plans, client education guides, and clinical pathways, as well as more on chapter topics such as diversity, ethics, religious beliefs affecting health care, and more.
